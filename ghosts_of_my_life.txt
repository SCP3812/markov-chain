The word ‘haunt’ and all the derivations thereof may be one of the closest English word to the German
‘unheimlich’, whose polysemic connotations and etymological echoes Freud so assiduously, and so
famously, unravelled in his essay on ‘The Uncanny’. Just as ‘German usage allows the familiar (das
Heimliche, the ‘homely’) to switch to its opposite, the uncanny (das Unheimliche, the ‘unhomely’)’
(Freud), so ‘haunt’ signifies both the dwelling-place, the domestic scene and that which invades or
disturbs it. The OED lists one of the earliest meanings of the word ‘haunt’ as ‘to provide with a home,
house.’
