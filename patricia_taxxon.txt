if you wanted a clean argument for how to be a furry without ignorant people calling you a zoophile, i’m sorry. being a furry is a gesture towards the zoophilic, you’re taking pleasure in that which is inhuman, not to skirt consent, but to be sexual and sensual as what you feel you truly are. you’ll never find an easy line in the sand to draw, you’ll never convince normies that being attracted to furries is exactly the same as being attracted to people, and doing so implies furrydom to be colorless and sterile. you can’t unsay what you know to be true in your heart, it’s too late. 
sometimes u watch a movie and the characters look like animals but they act like people so you start mentally interfacing with them as you would with people and also you’re gay and repressed and its easier to conceptualize attraction to an animal than it is to understand that you’re not straight
furry twitter incest drama that likely not many of you were present for. just seeing a guy say an incredibly common reaction to trauma should be openly called out & shot down wherever it may arise, and watching it get misrepresented in real time like “oh my god, all these perverts are freaking out over an innocuous statement, he JUST said that he should be ALLOWED to think incest is gross! some people have trauma” and then the other half just actually posting incest porn in his mentions like it just shouldn’t bother anyone. really a perfect storm of awful half-formed moralistic takes on kink coming from both sides of the debacle. 
some people react to trauma by developing a deep and profound aversion to the subject of it, and others react in the opposite way, becoming invulnerable to it or even fetishizing it. i feel like both of these groups wanna pretend the other doesn't exist, or tend to minimize them & place their own neurological concoction as being what "trauma" is. "Don't fetishize that, some people have trauma" vs "Don't demonize people who fetishize that, in fact, tolerate it openly. some people have trauma." it's all reductive tokenization & i hate it
it feels reductive to call my interest in furries a “fetish”, even if my personal interest is primarily sexual in nature. the shit i wrote about on the flowers of robert mapplethorpe is a fetish, but being a furry is a manifestation of my autistic sexuality. It’s less that I’m turned on when people are like animals, but animal physiology & mannerisms, cartoon heightening of expressions and body language, unique textures, that’s just a landscape in which my brain has an easier time doing most things, including being horny.
Yes! With regards to beings that are actually capable of judging us significant or not, we are actually very significant. The cosmos has no opinion of us, her terrifying breadth is a non-factor in this call.
