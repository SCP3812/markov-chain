I had the day off and had gone to sleep, although once i had awoken in my dream i didn't realize i was asleep.
I lived out day after day, week after week, month after month in this dream that i didn't even know was a dream, however it was not a good one.
Eventually at some distant future point the space station was de-orbited, i do not know if this was intentional, or if it was normal orbital decay, or if it was even the ISS and not just one of the Chinese stations, however, shortly after this there was a limited nuclear exchange in which 36 nuclear weapons were detonated in the Texas gulf region, i am unsure what happened with the rest of the country though but i imagine it was catastrophic, services never came back.
Shortly after this came airstrikes, no idea from who, it honestly looked like some variant of Su-30 Russian plane, only a few however before those too eventually stopped.
We never saw anything come out of them, all we remembered were screams, from everywhere, and these monsters that would peel the skin from children and parents and wear their skin, and they were capable of perfectly imitating the voices of the people whose skin they took, they did this to lure people out of their hiding spots and take them, killing yourself to escape them would not work, they could reanimate the dead (part 2 after this)

If you killed yourself to escape, it wouldn't work, they could reanimate the dead and keep you on some sort of life support for the sake of experimentation, i don't know why or how but somehow i knew that if they took you that you were theirs forever, there was no escape.
However they also had large facilities on the earth, they looked like normal warehouses but the ones who wore people's skin were inside these, they would liquefy humans in here and keep them in devices that looked similar to dryers, and each liquified human was kept in their own, and we had a hand scanner we could use to find where our person's remains were so we could steal them so that they couldn't re-constitute their remains and make them suffer, somehow we could reconstruct the entire person back to what they were with this liquid.
However the ones who wore people's skin had these large pools ringed with symbols that looked similar to zoroastrian dakhmas ( i don't know the spelling) and they would fill these pools with the people's liquefied remains and bathe in them, and their children would bathe in them and drink them, and they would try throwing people in and if you fell in then you were one of them.

I then remember her whispering to me very quietly, "we need to be quiet and turn all the lights off or they'll see us", we did this, and saw lights on the horizon slowly blinking out one by one by one, i don't know if the lights were really close enough or not, but i could swear i heard distant screaming, like there was a reason their lights were going off, as though even in our victory we were still being hunted, i do not know what our enemy was, we all just called it "Them"
Russian invasion of Crimea, Iraq falling apart and returning to a fractured state, Syrian intervention.
The next things to come along are that the rest of the middle east falls apart, not
just what we're already seeing but jordan, lebanon, saudi arabia, iran, pretty much everything except israel, eventually a space station (no idea which one or when/how) will de-orbit, a war between Russia and the U.S. is going to kick off, it's inevitable, Russia is going to invade up through Mexico, the red line is how far into the U.S. they end up advancing due to aid from the native Mexican population initiating an insurrection due to increased nationalism, and a weak quasi-breakup of the U.S. following a civil war. the green circle is a flashpoint where Russia didn't invade at first, they stayed on one side of the ship channel until finally attempting to cross it and that's when things go nuclear, 36 nuclear weapons are exhanged in and around the green circle, i have no idea how many are exchanged elsewhere as that is the last time we have internet or TV ever again, many other electronic devices and vehicles still worked however, mostly older ones though and for some reason as i said the hand held scanner for finding humans worked.

Russia does a few more strikes with aircraft that i assume were hardened against the initial nuclear exchange, although they very quickly stopped as i imagine they likely ran out of fuel or somesuch other reason, very soon after this is when the ships arrived.
We slept underground under the house in case the things in the dark came inside and found us, i think they were little more than animals, maybe something 'they' left behind, but i don't know.
I don't even know if the long dark was permanent or not, as that's when the dream ended, the sun was dying, it was also possible in addition to this that it was nighttime as it was that the sun had died or that 'they' had moved an object in front of it to obfuscate the earth, or maybe it was residual atmospheric debris from the nuclear war and everything else that had happened, i know for a fact that something did happen to the sun though so it could've been a compounded mixture of these events.
In addition to all of this, i say Mexican uprising, what i mean is that the Mexico aligned with Russia and most of south America/central America, so this coupled with Russia allowed for a fairly robust invasion, the U.S. had been weakened substantially already as i said due to the internal civil war, whether it is related to this election or not though I'm not sure, under normal circumstances i doubt they would be able to pull off an invasion though so we must've been fairly weakened, i know the white house and the capitol was taken by the people's revolutionary force (shit name but that's what they called themselves or had grown to be called anyways), so for the most part the government had already been decapitated before the invasion.
In addition to all of this (Again) the invasion and subsequent nuclear exchange had all come about very quickly, i was out in the back yard with my mother putting white christmas lights in the backyard as patio lights, i don't think it was near christmas though.
We had literally walked inside and my dad was laying on the floor watching tv and had said "well i guess we just started world war 3" and not 20 seconds after that the first flash went off outside near what would probably be the Pasadena area of Houston, followed by the large area of petro-chemical plants on the other side of the ship channel, they looked to be fairly low yield (10-20kt range) as though they
were specifically trying to target smaller areas but i don't know, we got the shockwave where i was and our windows were blown out but the building was still in tact with little damage.
