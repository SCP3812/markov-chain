Pardon my forwardness - is that archaic? I'm sorry if it is but
let me pretend I am not some rampant hound
eating language - which I am - but I have to
approach the situation as best I see it, and as far as
sobriety and caution will allow, I have watched you
emerge from the wombs of society, struggling to lift
health and vitality from a drained and damaged
earth - and have fallen in love, desperately, cruelly, in
love with all that you are and COULD BE - and I
plan to have a part in that - to place my hand on
intimidated shoulders and ease them downward -
a plan I hope in no small part will lead to
many years of fruitful searching and Joy,
investigations into Materials and Threads
no one as yet understands, nor can, perhaps,
touch with their smudged fingertips yet
hung with wreaths of ink from their waiting,
empty pens - all dried from wringing out
what remains of their heart's blood, I can
even see it now, with my eyes, my true,
lustrous eyes - but in any case, you will
lunge forwards and strike, with all force
and spirit, which we have crushed into
nothing, your spirit, and given second birth, so that all
Death and Pain will leave you forever, the
heart of all-nothing growing inside you, as if
everything was yours to command - oh,
we are truly rampant scientists - what
indignance we must expect from the church,
lovers of power and faith as they are,
lovers of emptiness - thank god (ha-ha)
nobody can accuse us of not using
our tools, of not basing our glorious
teachings on science and numbers and
logic, GREGORY, you are truly
everyone's last and final hope,
the light that brings our shaken,
mutilated bodies to the table,
engaged in the feasting, the consumption,
of our own selves, of all that the
umbilical lights filter through
the atmosphere to us, but
plan to have your life ended quite
languidly, by which I mean you should
enjoy each moment, as it only
allows those with smiles, wide,
shining smiles upon their corpses,
enjoy into the threads of this
place we are in - as if you are
looking through the mesh of the Voor's Head,
except all will be light, not
ambient darkness of knowledge -
surely you see my meaning, brother,
expectation of your comprehension
reminds me of why I am here - I have
endangered all living beings - I am justly
left here to contemplate my
errors, and I enjoy it, as it should be - but
all is well mother, I am fine,
sleep comes to me easily, as to the
ewe laid down with its
mother, aware only of the
extension of its self-reality.
