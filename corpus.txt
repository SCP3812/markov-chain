Pardon my forwardness - is that archaic? I'm sorry if it is but
let me pretend I am not some rampant hound
eating language - which I am - but I have to
approach the situation as best I see it, and as far as
sobriety and caution will allow, I have watched you
emerge from the wombs of society, struggling to lift
health and vitality from a drained and damaged
earth - and have fallen in love, desperately, cruelly, in
love with all that you are and COULD BE - and I
plan to have a part in that - to place my hand on
intimidated shoulders and ease them downward -
a plan I hope in no small part will lead to
many years of fruitful searching and Joy,
investigations into Materials and Threads
no one as yet understands, nor can, perhaps,
touch with their smudged fingertips yet
hung with wreaths of ink from their waiting,
empty pens - all dried from wringing out
what remains of their heart's blood, I can
even see it now, with my eyes, my true,
lustrous eyes - but in any case, you will
